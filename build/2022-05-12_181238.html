Oh well.<h2 id=why>Why</h2><p>I wanted a minimalistically cool blog like <a href=https://erzadel.net/><span class=citation data-cites=edel>@edel</span>’s</a> and <a href=https://joelchrono12.xyz/><span class=citation data-cites=joel>@joel</span>’s</a> websites.<p>My previous blog setup was made using <a href=https://franklinjl.org/>Franklin.jl</a>, and building it implied setting up an entire julia installation. And even after all that, the blog looked pretty boring. I still struggled to set up tags and I had to constantly fight the default css or write everything myself. Also, when I built that blog, I was learning JS, and I used a lot of unnecessary js and styling. Finally, Franklin’s complex build meant that <a href=./2021-09-06_010053>my gemini build</a> was so much more harder to make.<h2 id=enter-pandoc>Enter pandoc</h2><p>I still wanted to write in markdown and make it to html. The best converter I know is pandoc. It has a very good template support, and having used it before, I was comfortable with it. I had already made a <a href=https://foambubble.github.io/foam/>foam</a> <a href=https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/notes-template>template</a> for jekyll for my <a href=https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/notes>notes this semester</a>, and modifying it to match pandoc’s template was easy.<h2 id=gemini-build>Gemini Build</h2><p>The best part of pandoc is that it is so easily extendable. There is a gemtext filter for pandoc which meant that with just one more command I could also build my gemini capsule. I had to tweak the filter a bit to add <code>.gmi</code> to links where necessary, which was technically a simple change, but I don’t know lua, so I flailed around a bit before I got it. Templating for gemini was even easier since there isn’t much you can do in the first place.<h2 id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h2><p>I initially thought I would make the blog like a digital garden, but then decided against since I knew I wouldn’t write too much to actually populate the garden enough. And setting up such a thing I felt was way too complicated for a low traffic blog like mine.<p>So I ended making a Table of Contents. Previously, I just had the entry as the filename, but that was very difficult to follow. With a little of <code>sed</code>-fu, I extracted the title from the front matter. With a tiny change, I made it work for gemini too.<p>At this point, I was going to release the new blog, but then I had a new itch<h2 id=rss>RSS</h2><p>I wanted to also have an RSS feed. I already use RSS extensively for comics, <a href=./2022-04-29_150432>science</a> and other blogs, and wanted people to see mine too. I searched online a bit for an RSS maker script, but I only found subscription stuff. I was almost going to write my own script, when I came across a post on fosstodon which talked about an RSS-only blog. They used txt files to manage their content, but converting markdown to html was already possible with pandoc, so with some heavy modifications, I built the RSS feed with a script<h2 id=zk>ZK</h2><p>At this point, I was ALMOST going to publish it. I had made everything I wanted to. Just a few more CSS fixes, and we were good to go. But as I was setting up markdown support for lunarvim, I came across <a href=https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk>zk</a>. And this blew my mind. Without me doing anything, it gave me everything I needed. Contents were just one command away, and for almost free, I got tag support.<p>Within a day, I set up zk, added tags to my previous articles, added a new template for the tags page, and fixed some other templates. I also added a cute neon effect to the tag list at the end of every page. I found a small mistake in the gemini script, which I fixed.<p>Now, my blog is perfect.<p>Except…<h2 id=fediring-and-512kb-club>Fediring and 512KB club</h2><p>I really want to add my blog to both of these. For 512KB, I don’t know whether it is per page or per site. Right now, my site sits at 131KB for the whole thing, but that is with 8 posts. Every post I add, I add about 1KB. I don’t know how people are getting their sites to less than 100KB. That seems impossible.<p>As for fediring, it is just a matter of doing it, which I haven’t done.</div><div class="markdown-body tags"><a href=/home/dhruva/tags.html#blog>#blog<a>, <a href=/home/dhruva/tags.html#web>#web<a>, <a href=/home/dhruva/tags.html#gemini>#gemini<a>, <a href=/home/dhruva/tags.html#mycreation>#mycreation<a></div><footer><a id=home href=/home/dhruva/>Home</a>
