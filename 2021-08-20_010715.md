# Closer to Truth

I was going to the mall when I saw three people sitting on the bench. As I approached them they started running away.
I was surprised by this. Pleasantly surprised. It was rare that people ran from me, they generally fainted. I don't really blame them. How often do you see Death anyway?

Non-believers were generally the ones that reacted worse than the believers. I suppose that the believers already plan for this moment. I've really wondered though, is it that they are closer to the truth because they believe in Me or are they further away because they do so without any real evidence. I never leave evidence.
